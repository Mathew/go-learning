package quote

const Sediment = `I wake up with a humming glow of a hundred Percocets
I have the arms of a baby
Veins of an old lady
My vision is runny and profound
There's a still light we sit behind
You turn to me and ask if I'd like you to stay
But I didn't have anything here
I say "I should have dissolved in you
But I made us statistics
They can write us off
But I don't fucking deserve you"
You look confused
But after a very awkward pause
You kiss my cheek and then walk off
Left alone now I start to age backwards
And I'm viciously hungering for someone
To love me the way my parents never did
There must be someone who can somewhere
Maybe I'll take a walk and see
After all it's so big
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on`
